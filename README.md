# blockly
The web-based visual programming editor.

My Changes: 
*added the closure library and made the necessary changes to demos/code/index.html to 
enable live editing of /core and /blocks files

*freed up whole colour spectrum by making saturation and value local variables, like hue was

*Recast the blocks I want to use in Linkitz branded colours
